# 🚦 Railway Gate Traffic Monitoring System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Railway Gate Traffic Monitoring System** is an intelligent application designed to optimize traffic management at railway crossings. By leveraging **sensors, GPS technology, and real-time data processing**, this system enhances safety and minimizes congestion by predicting train arrival times and controlling vehicle movement accordingly.

## 🎯 Features
- 📡 **Real-time Train Detection** - Uses sensors and GPS to detect approaching trains.
- 🚗 **Smart Traffic Management** - Controls vehicle flow based on train schedules.
- 📊 **Live Data Visualization** - Displays real-time status of railway crossings.
- 🔔 **Automated Alerts** - Notifies users about gate closures and expected waiting times.
- 📱 **User-Friendly Interface** - Provides clear insights for operators and drivers.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Hardware:** IoT Sensors, GPS Modules
- **Backend:** Node.js, Python (Flask)
- **Frontend:** React.js, Chart.js for data visualization
- **Database:** Firebase / MongoDB for real-time data storage
- **APIs:** Google Maps API for location tracking

## 📌 How It Works
1. **Train Detection:** Sensors/GPS detect approaching trains and send data to the server.
2. **Data Processing:** The system analyzes train speed and estimated arrival time.
3. **Traffic Management:** Alerts are sent to nearby vehicles and the railway gate is controlled.
4. **User Notifications:** Displays live updates on web/app dashboards.
